## Project-5 for Udacity MAchine Learning NanoDegree

My submission for project 5 - Image classification using CNN and Deep Learning for Udacity's **Machine Learning NanoDegree**

In this project I build a Image classifier based on the CIFAR-10 dataset. 

We:
1. pre process the images to normalize them, 
2. one hot encode the labels 
3. create a tensorflow convolutional neural network graph
4. split data into a training set and a test set 
5. create a model using the training set 
6. improve the model by tweaking hyper-parameters, variable initialization values, addition/deletion of convolutional layers and fully connected layers. 

We then evaluate the training accuracy versus the test accuracy to figure out the number of epochs to run. 

Finally we evaluate the algorithm on photos found on the internet.
